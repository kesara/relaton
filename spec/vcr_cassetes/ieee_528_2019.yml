        They apply to two modes of use: (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments
        typical of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed
        platform applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro
        is subjected are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of
        the strap-down DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are
        considered to the extent necessary to define the gyro performance. Learn More

        for Precision Centrifuge Testing of Linear Accelerometers This recommended

        be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques. The term
        u201cprecision,u201d in this context, refers to tests that are conducted to
        evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer
        output complies with specific error limit criteria. Learn More Facebook Twitter

        for Precision Centrifuge Testing of Linear Accelerometers This recommended

        be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques. The term
        u201cprecision,u201d in this context, refers to tests that are conducted to
        evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer
        output complies with specific error limit criteria. Learn More Facebook Twitter

        evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer

        using centrifuge techniques. The term u201cprecision,u201d in this context,
        refers to tests that are conducted to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as
        opposed to those conducted to establish environmental survivability only.
        Evaluation may take the form of determining the coefficients of the accelerometer''s
        model equation, except for bias and scale factor, which are most accurately
        determined by static multi-position tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only
        establish that the accelerometer output complies with specific error limit

        using centrifuge techniques. The term u201cprecision,u201d in this context,
        refers to tests that are conducted to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as
        opposed to those conducted to establish environmental survivability only.
        Evaluation may take the form of determining the coefficients of the accelerometer''s
        model equation, except for bias and scale factor, which are most accurately
        determined by static multi-position tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only
        establish that the accelerometer output complies with specific error limit

        sensor in operating environments typical of aircraft and missile applications,
        and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform applications in which the dynamic
        angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected are benign relative to the accuracy
        required. In the case of the strap-down DTG, the characteristics of the external
        capture loops are considered to the extent necessary to define the gyro performance.

        for Precision Centrifuge Testing of Linear Accelerometers This recommended
        practice describes the conduct and analysis of precision tests that are to
        be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques. The term
        u201cprecision,u201d in this context, refers to tests that are conducted to
        evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer

        platform applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro

        for the preparation of a two-degree-of-freedom dynamically tuned gyro (DTG)
        specification is given that provides a common ground of terminology and practice
        for manufacturers and users. A compilation of recommended procedures for testing
        a DTG is also given. The requirements and test procedures are defined in terms
        unique to the DTG. They cover applications of the gyro as an angular motion
        sensor in navigation and control systems. They apply to two modes of use:
        (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments typical of aircraft and
        missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform applications
        in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected are benign
        relative to the accuracy required. In the case of the strap-down DTG, the
        characteristics of the external capture loops are considered to the extent
        necessary to define the gyro performance. Sponsor Committee AES\/GA - Gyro

        Dynamically Tuned Gyros A format guide for the preparation of a two-degree-of-freedom
        dynamically tuned gyro (DTG) specification is given that provides a common
        ground of terminology and practice for manufacturers and users. A compilation
        of recommended procedures for testing a DTG is also given. The requirements
        and test procedures are defined in terms unique to the DTG. They cover applications
        of the gyro as an angular motion sensor in navigation and control systems.
        They apply to two modes of use: (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments
        typical of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed
        platform applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro
        is subjected are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of
        the strap-down DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are
        considered to the extent necessary to define the gyro performance. Learn More
